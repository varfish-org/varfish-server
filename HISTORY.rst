v0.23.7
-------

**IMPORTANT**

This release contains a critical update.
Prior to this release, all small and structural variant tables were marked as ``UNLOGGED``.
This was originally introduce to improve insert performance.
However, it turned out that stability is greatly decreased.
In the case of a PostgreSQL crash, these tables are emptied.
This change should have been rolled back much earlier but that rollback was buggy.
**This release now includes a working and verified fix.**

Full Change List
================

  The databases ``Hpo`` and ``HpoName`` don't match necessarly via ``hpo_id``, in this case because of an obsolete HPO id ``HP:0031988``.
  Now reporting ``"unknown"`` for the name instead of ``None`` which broke the sorting routine.
