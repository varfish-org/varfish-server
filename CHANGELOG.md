- Fixed bug that occurred when sample statistics were available but sample was marked with having no genotype.
- Adjusted genotype quality strict filter setting to 10.
- Added possibility to export VCF file for cohorts.

- Loading annotation and QC tabs in project cases list asyncronously.
- Increased timeout for VariantValidator response to 30 seconds.
- Digesting more VariantValidator responses, namely `intergenic_variant_\d+` and `validation_warning_\d+`.
- Fixed bug where when re-importing a case, the sample variants stats computation was performed on the member list of the old case. This could lead to the inconsistent state that when new members where added, the stats were not available for them. This lead to a 500 error when displaying the case overview page.
- Fixed missing QC plots in case detail view.
- Fixed bug in case VCF export where a variant existing twice in the results was breaking the export.
- Fixed log entries for file export when pathogenicity or phenotype scoring was activated. The variants are sorted by score in this case which led to messy logging which was designed for logging when the chromosome changes.

- CADD is now selected as default in pathogenicity scoring form (when available).
- Added global maintenance commands to clear old kiosk cases, inactive variant sets and expired exported files.

- Fixed bug that left number of small variants empty when they actually existed. This happened when SNVs and SVs were imported at the same time.
- Increased logging during case import.
- Marked old style import as deprecated.
- Fixed bug that prevented re-import of SVs by altering the unique constraint on the `StructuralVariant` table.
- Fixed bug where a re-import of genotypes was not possible when the same variant types weren\'t present as in the initial import. This was done by adding a `state` field to the `VariantSetImportInfo` model.
- Fixed bug where `imported` state of `CaseImportInfo` was already set after importing the first variant set.
- Integrated Genomics England PanelApp via their API.
- Added command to check selected indexes and data types in database.

- Added warning to project/cohort query when a user tries to load previous results where not all variants are accessible.
- Renamed all occurrences of whitelist to allowlist and of blacklist to blocklist (sticking to what google introduced in their products).
- Fixed bug where cases were not deletable when using Chrome browser.
- Harmonized computation for relatedness in project-wide QC and in case QC (thus showing the same results if project only contains one family).
- Fixed failing case API re-import when user is not owner of previous import. Now also all users with access to the project (except guests) can list the cases.
- Added `PROJECTROLES_EMAIL_` to config.
- Avoiding variants with asterisk alternative alleles.

- Added command `import_cases_bulk` for case bulk import, reading arguments from a JSON file.
- Entering and suggeting HPO terms now requires at least 3 typed charaters. Also only sending the query if the HPO term string changed to reduce number of executed database queries.
- Fixed broken variant details page when an HPO id had no matching HPO name. This happened when gathering HPO names, retrieving HPO id from `Hpo` database given the OMIM id and then the name from `HpoName`. The databases `Hpo` and `HpoName` don\'t match necessarly via `hpo_id`, in this case because of an obsolete HPO id `HP:0031988`. Now reporting `"unknown"` for the name instead of `None` which broke the sorting routine.
- Fixed bug in `ProjectCasesFilterView` where previous genomic regions where not properly restored in the form.
- Fixed bug that lead to an AJAX error in the filter view when previous filter results failed to load because the variants of a case were deleted in the meantime.
- Entering the filter view is now only possible when there are variants and a variant set. When there are variant reported but no variant set, a warning in form of a small red icon next to the number of variants is displayed, complaining about an inconsistent state.

- Added `django_su` to allow superusers to temporarily take on the identity of another user.
- Fixed bug in which some variants in comphet mode only had one variant in results list.
