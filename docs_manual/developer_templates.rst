Templates (for Issues etc.)
===========================

We do organize bug reports and feature request in the
`Github issue tracker <https://github.com/bihealth/varfish-server/issues/new/choose>`_.
Please choose the template that fits best what you want to report and fill out
the questions to help us decide on how to approach the task.

Bug Reports
-----------

The template for bug reports has the following form (an up-to-date form is located in the Github issue tracker):

.. code-block:: markdown

    **To Reproduce**
    Steps to reproduce the behavior:
    1. Go to '...'
    2. Click on '....'
    3. Scroll down to '....'
    4. See error

    **Expected behavior**
    A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Root Cause Analysis
===================

In the following, a root cause analysis (RCA) needs to be done. The ticket will get an answer with the title
**Root Cause Analysis** and a thorough description of what might cause the bug.

Resolution Proposal
===================

When the root cause is determined, a solution needs to be proposed, following this form:

.. code-block:: markdown

    **Resolution Proposal**
    e.g. The component X needs to be changed to Y so Z is not executed when M occurs.

    **Affected Components**
    e.g. VarFish server

    **Affected Modules/Files**
    e.g. variants module or queries.py

    **Required Architectural Changes**
    e.g. Function F needs to be moved to X.

    **Required Database Changes**
    i.e. name any model that needs changing, to be added and will lead to a migration

    **Backport Possible?**
    e.g., "Yes" if this is a bug fix or small change and should be backported to the current stable version

    **Resolution Sketch**
    e.g. Change X in F. Then do Y.


Commits
=======

Almost all commits should refer to a ticket in trailing parenthesis, e.g.

::

    Resolve some issue (#NUMBER)

Required trailing lines are required for each commit.
You must either specify ``Related-Issue`` or ``No-Related-Issue``.
Examples:

::

    Related-Issue: #123
    No-Related-Issue: Short text reason

Further, each commit should be marked whether it is expected to change filtration results with ``Projected-Results-Impact``.
Allowed values are ``none`` or ``require-revalidation``.

::

    Projected-Results-Impact: none
    Projected-Results-Impact: require-revalidation

Fix & Pull Request
==================

1. Create new branch (name starts with issue number), e.g. ``123-fix-for-issue``
2. Create pull request in "Draft" state
3. Fix problem, ideally in a test-driven way, remove "Draft" state

Review & Merge
==============

1. Perform code review
2. Ensure fix is documented in changelog (link to bug and PR #ids)

----------------
Feature Requests
----------------

A feature request follows the same workflow as a bug request (an up-to-date form is located in the Github issue tracker):

.. code-block:: markdown

    **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
    A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

    **Describe the solution you'd like**
    A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

    **Describe alternatives you've considered**
    A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

    **Additional context**
    Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.


Design
======

In the following, the design of the feature needs to be specified:

.. code-block:: markdown

    **Implementation Proposal**
    e.g. The component X needs to be changed to Y so Z is not executed when M occurs.

    **Affected Components**
    e.g. VarFish server

    **Affected Modules/Files**
    e.g. variants module or queries.py

    **Required Architectural Changes**
    e.g. Function F needs to be moved to X.

    **Implementation Sketch**
    e.g. Change X in F. Then do Y.

Implement & Test
================

1. Create feature branch, named starting with issue ID
2. Perform implementation, ideally in a test-driven way
3. Tests and documentation must be augmented/updated as well

Review & Merge
==============

1. Perform code review
2. Ensure change is documented in changelog (link to feature issue and PR #ids)
