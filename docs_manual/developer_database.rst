Database Import
===============

To prepare the VarFish database, follow `the instructions for the VarFish DB Downloader <https://github.com/bihealth/varfish-db-downloader>`_.
Downloading and processing the data can take multiple days.

The VarFish DB Downloader working folder consumes 1.7Tb for GRCh37 and 5.4Tb for GRCh38.
The pre-computed tables for VarFish consume 208Gb and the final
postgres database consumes 500Gb. Please make sure that there is enough free
space available. However, we recommend to exclude the large databases:
Frequency tables, extra annotations and dbSNP. Also, keep in mind that
importing the whole database takes >24h, depending on the speed of your HDD.

In the future, we plan to provide a pre-build package for import.

This is a list of the possible imports, sorted by its size:

===================  ====  ==================  ===================================

You can find the ``import_versions.tsv`` file in the root folder of the
package. This file determines which component (called ``table_group`` and
represented as folder in the package) gets imported when the import command is
issued. To exclude a component, simply comment out (``#``) or delete the line.

A space-consumption-friendly version of the file would look like this::

    build   table_group version

    #GRCh37 dbSNP   b155

To perform the import, issue::

    $ python manage.py import_tables --tables-path varfish-db-downloader
