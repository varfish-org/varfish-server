VarFish is based on the SODAR core framework which has a `developer manual <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html>`_
itself. It is worth having a look there. The following lists parts that are useful in particular:

- `Models <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_project_app.html#models>`_
- `Rules <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_project_app.html#rules-file>`_
- `Views <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_project_app.html#views>`_
- `Templates <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_project_app.html#templates>`_
    - `Icons <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_general.html#using-icons>`_
- `Forms <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_project_app.html#forms>`_
